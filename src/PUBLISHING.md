Component Publishing and Discovery System Design

1. Component Addressing Scheme:
   - Format: `user/component-name/version`
   - Example: `alice@example.com/cool-widget/1.0.0`

2. Component Metadata:
   - Name
   - Version
   - Author
   - Description
   - Tags
   - Dependencies
   - Access Control List (ACL)
   - Encryption Key (for private components)

3. Gun Graph Structure:
```
components/
  ├── public/
  │   └── [user-id]/
  │       └── [component-name]/
  │           └── [version]/
  │               ├── metadata
  │               └── code
  └── private/
      └── [user-id]/
          └── [component-name]/
              └── [version]/
                  ├── metadata (encrypted)
                  └── code (encrypted)
```

4. Publishing Process:
   a. User creates a component
   b. User sets metadata and access controls
   c. System encrypts private components
   d. System publishes to the appropriate Gun graph location

5. Discovery Mechanism:
   - Public component registry
   - Search by tags, author, or component name
   - Filtered results based on user's access rights

6. Access Control:
   - Public: Anyone can access
   - Private: Only specified users can access
   - Shared: List of user public keys with access

7. Encryption:
   - Use SEA for encryption/decryption
   - Encrypt private components with a symmetric key
   - Encrypt the symmetric key with authorized users' public keys

8. Component Loading:
   - Fetch component metadata and code from Gun graph
   - Decrypt if necessary
   - Validate dependencies
   - Load and instantiate component

9. Version Management:
   - Semantic versioning for components
   - Support for specifying version ranges in dependencies

10. Integration with Existing System:
    - Extend Component class with publishing methods
    - Add component discovery and loading to DecentralizedApp
    - Integrate with DevTools for debugging published components

11. User Interface:
    - Component publishing interface in DevTools
    - Component discovery and installation UI
    - Access control management interface

12. Security Considerations:
    - Code signing for integrity verification
    - Sandboxing for running untrusted components
    - Rate limiting for publishing and discovery requests

13. Offline Support:
    - Local cache of installed components
    - Sync updates when online

14. Collaboration Features:
    - Fork and modify existing components
    - Pull requests for component updates
    - Comments and ratings on public components
